            <p>So today you are standing right at your mid-twenties. From smol avi to the tall avi, you've come a long way. Adulting is not so fun, I know. The path ahead might look uncertain with quarter-life crisis hitting hard. But, you are a strong and kind girlie. You're intelligent, compassionate, cute, and really fun. You're a flawless cook too. All those tasty dishes that you make when you're feeling like cooking, your family is really lucky they get to taste all of it. You have braved the toughest of times and you have made yourself better with everything that has come your way. There's a lot of goodness that's coming your way in life so do not let your lovely smile fade away. All the wonderful people, your parents, your friends, they are always there for you, standing behind you like a wall and they will not let you fall. So let go of your worries and just let the things happen. You'll be alright :)</p>
